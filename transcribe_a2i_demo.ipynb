    "# Improving Amazon Transcribe transcriptions using Custom Vocabularies and Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accompanies the blog \"Improving Amazon Transcribe transcriptions using Custom Vocabularies and Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)\" (TODO: add link)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When transcribing speech containing domain-specific terminologies in fields such as legal, financial, construction, higher education, or engineering, Amazon Transcribe’s [custom vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-vocabulary.html) feature can improve transcription quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use custom vocabularies with Amazon Transcribe, you need a list of domain-specific terms. If you have a collection of videos or audio files (dataset) that you want transcribed with high accuracy, you can use a portion of your dataset to Amazon Transcribe to assess which terms it has difficulty with (low confidence predictions). You can use Amazon A2I to send these low-confidence predictions directly to a human to review and manually transcribe the terms. This walkthrough will demonstrate how you can process the results obtained from Amazon A2I to quickly to build a custom vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, in this walkthrough you will:\n",
    "* Send a subset of videos to Amazon Transcribe to find terms that are difficult to transcribe.\n",
    "* Set up a human review workflow using Amazon A2I to send low-confidence predictions to humans for manual review and transcription.\n",
    "* Create a custom vocabulary using the results obtained from human workers.\n",
    "* Test Amazon Transcribe on another subset of videos to asses the improvement in transcription quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you can simply execute each cell in order. To understand what's happening, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An S3 bucket you can write to -- please provide its name in BUCKET. The bucket must be in the same region as this SageMaker Notebook instance. You can also change the EXP_NAME to any valid S3 prefix. All the files related to this experiment will be stored in that prefix of your bucket.\n",
    "* Familiarity with the Amazon A2I.\n",
    "* Familiarity with Python and numpy.\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with AWS S3.\n",
    "* Basic understanding of Amazon Transcribe and custom vocabularies. \n",
    "* Basic familiarity with AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) -- ideally, you should have it set up with credentials to access the AWS account you're running this notebook from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has only been tested on a SageMaker notebook instance. The runtimes given are approximate. We used an ml.t2.medium instance in our tests. However, you can likely run it on a local instance by first executing the cell below on SageMaker and then copying the role string to your local copy of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Create a work task template that will be displayed to workers for every task. The template will be rendered with input data you provide, instructions to workers, and interactive tools to help workers complete your tasks.\n",

    "3. Create a human loop to start the human review workflow, sending data for human review as needed. In this example, you use a custom task type and start human loop tasks using the [Amazon A2I Runtime API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/2019-11-07/APIReference/Welcome.html). Each time StartHumanLoop is called, a task is sent to human reviewers."

For applications like search engine optimization (SEO), it could be critical that these technical terms are transcribed correctly. Let’s take a look at how our custom vocabulary impacted the transcription of several important technical terms:\n",

    "In this post, we walked through an example of how you can improve transcripts from Amazon Transcribe using custom vocabularies and an Amazon A2I human review workflow. This allows you to quickly identify domain-specific terms using your own private workforce and review workflows, and use these terms to build a custom vocabulary so that future mentions of term are transcribed with greater accuracy, at scale. Transcribing key technical terms correctly can be important for doing SEO, enabling highly specific textual queries, and grouping large quantities of video or audio files by technical terms.\n",
